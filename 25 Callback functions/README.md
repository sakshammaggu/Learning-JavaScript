Callback functions in JavaScript are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions, with the intention that they will be invoked (or called back) at a later point in time, typically after some asynchronous operation has completed or when certain conditions are met. Callback functions are a fundamental aspect of JavaScript's asynchronous programming paradigm, allowing for non-blocking behavior and enabling operations like event handling, asynchronous I/O, and more.

Here's a basic example of a callback function in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Function that takes a callback as an argument
function doSomethingAsync(callback) {
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log("Async operation complete.");
        callback(); // Calling the callback function
    }, 1000); // Simulating an asynchronous operation
}

// Callback function
function callbackFunction() {
    console.log("Callback function executed.");
}

// Calling the function with the callback
doSomethingAsync(callbackFunction);
```

In this example:

- `doSomethingAsync` is a function that takes a callback function `callback` as an argument.
- Inside `doSomethingAsync`, a simulated asynchronous operation (using `setTimeout`) is performed.
- Once the asynchronous operation is complete, the callback function `callback` is invoked.
- The `callbackFunction` is defined separately and is passed as an argument when calling `doSomethingAsync`.

Callback functions are extensively used in JavaScript, especially in scenarios where you need to perform tasks asynchronously, handle events, make HTTP requests, work with timers, and more. They are a key building block for implementing complex asynchronous behavior in JavaScript applications. However, they can lead to callback hell or nested callbacks, which can make code hard to read and maintain. This issue is often addressed using techniques like promises, async/await, or functional programming concepts like higher-order functions.

In this, primitive datatypes and objects has been briefly discussed.

1) 'Primitive Datatypes':  
  
'Number': Represents numeric values, both integers and floating-point numbers.
Example: let age = 25;
            
'String': Represents sequences of characters, enclosed in single or double quotes.
Example: let name = 'John';
            
'Boolean': Represents a logical entity and can have only two values: true or false.
Example: let isStudent = true;
            
'Undefined': Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
Example: let undefinedVar;
            
'Null': Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
Example: let nullVar = null;
            
'Symbol': Introduced in ECMAScript 6, symbols are unique and immutable data types often used as object keys.
Example: let sym = Symbol('unique');  

2) 'Objects': Objects are complex data types that can hold key-value pairs and methods. They are dynamic and can be modified during runtime.
JavaScript objects provide a powerful and flexible way to structure and organize data.
They can be used to represent real-world entities and encapsulate related functionality within methods.

It's important to note that while primitive data types are immutable (values cannot be changed), objects are mutable, meaning their properties can be modified after creation. 
Understanding the distinction between primitives and objects is crucial for effective JavaScript programming.

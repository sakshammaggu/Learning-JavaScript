In JavaScript, conditional expressions are constructs that allow you to make decisions in your code based on certain conditions. 
These expressions are crucial for controlling the flow of your program and executing different blocks of code depending on whether a condition evaluates to true or false. 
The most common form of conditional expression in JavaScript is the if statement, and it can be extended with else and else if clauses.

1. if statement:
   if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if the condition is true
}

2. if-else statement:
   if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if the condition is true
}
  else{
}
